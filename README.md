# ROS Basics

This repository is one of the practical of the Robotics Practicals (RP) course at EPFL (MICRO-453).<br>

We first designed a simplified version of the Thymio robot in the URDF file format. 
The main goal of this practical was to make this robot model capable of waypoint following and obstacle avoidance. 
These control strategies were implemented in ROS and simulated with Gazebo. 
Finally, we tested the codes we had developed for the simulation on a real Thymio robot in order to compare the control performance in both cases.<br>

The "main" directory is associated with testing on real robot and the "box" is for simulating Thymio in a small simulated box. The report is also accessible in this repository.<br>
